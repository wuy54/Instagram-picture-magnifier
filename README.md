# Instagram-picture-magnifier
_____________________________
This is a chrome extension that can display pictures you selected on Instagram's website in a new tab. <br />
This magnifier works on both posts and stories.<br />

### How to use
"Profile" button prints the profile picture of the instagram user's page that you are visiting. <br />
"Story/Post/MoreThan3PicLast" for the picture/thumbnail of stories, single picture posts and the last picture of multiple picture posts. <br />
"MultiPicPost" for the first one to the one before the last one pictures in that multiple pictures post.<br />
"vscoPic" is still in progress. Pressing the button may have unexpected behavior.

#### Note: 10/22/2022 <br />
As web version Instagram was written to use "blob" to store all videos, the "VideoStory" button does no work anymore.<br />
I may go on make it work on blob files.
